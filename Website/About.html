    <p>Setting :</p>
    <p>The year is 3055 and the climate crisis has gotten out of hand. The weather is unpredictable, and trees struggle to grow and reproduce in the new climate. The human population steadily decreases due to the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. The task presented is to try and delay the extinction of humans by keeping enough trees alive to produce oxygen for the remaining group of humans. How long can you prevent the inevitable?</p>
