    <p class="pp">Setting:</p>
    <p>The year is 3055 and the climate crisis has gotten out of hand. The weather is unpredictable, and trees struggle to grow and reproduce in the new climate. The human population steadily decreases due to the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. The task presented is to try and delay the extinction of humans by keeping enough trees alive to produce oxygen for the remaining group of humans. How long can you prevent the inevitable?</p>
    <p class="pp">Aim/How to play:</p>
    <p>
      The overall aim of this game is to reduce the global warning in the environment, which can be done by planting trees according taking into account the loss of trees. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="pp">About the project:</p>
    <p>
      The player needs to water the plant till it reaches its full growth, whereby they can earn currencty by cutting the tree, but also maintaining the global warming levels by filling the water tank, and maintaining the cycle.
      The game also consists of different sounds effects and further features which can be explored when visited!!!
      This is a continuous cycle where the leagacy of the trees is maintained, and also maintained by natural and unnatural chain of events.
    </p>
    <p class="pp">Complexities in the code:</p>
    <p>You have to reach as far as possible... <br>
      Also consider the over-population of the trees!
